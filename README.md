# John Williams Google Doodle

The goal of this Google Doodle is to celebrate the musical genius that is John Williams. He has created so many iconic scores for some of the most impactful movies of all time. These movies include (in no particular order): Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Jaws, ET: The Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Home Alone and so many more. Part of what makes these movies so good are the scores that set the tone so perfectly with what is happening in each scene.

When you listen to one of his pieces, he has an unmistakable sound. It tends to be very bright and intense in a way that’s cheerful and triumphant. He also has the ability to express a sense of softness and calmness. He can effortlessly bring a sense of terror, darkness, or intimidation when needed. No matter what feeling and emotion you are trying to convey on screen, John Williams can back it up with his music. 

So here’s to John Williams, one of the greatest composers in film history.
